                                 New generation can not live without social media!
First of all I wanna start with internet, because if there is no internet then there is no social media too and these two has became our best friends. 

As a young generation everithing we do is connected with internet, we do our assignments in computer which is connected with internet, or when we wanna travel we are able to buy tickets on internet, or check the schedule everey day to see what you are going to do on school, listen to your favorite music, have contact with your familj around the world, all of these are able when we have internet.

Nowadays not everyone is reading newspaper to check on enviroment and society that what is hapening around him or her, me prsonally I get information about everything in instagram or facebook or other apps that I use to know about the world.

Some people belives that internet and social media is not good and have manny negitives things, and new generation is going to spend more time with intrnet then familj or real friends.  
There are good and bad ways of using internet but we can not blame social media or internet for something we do which we should not do, and we can say social media is car and we are drivers of it, now we have to decide we wanna chose bad ways to crach or chose good ways to rich to that goal we have.

The conclusion is that life is mach esier with internet and it can be much diffucult too but we can chose which one we want, and it depends on us how we use internet.
